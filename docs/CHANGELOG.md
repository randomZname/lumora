# CHANGELOG — MVP_AI

Newest first. Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD` then `- what — why`.

## 2026-07-04 (auth + payments + prod video fix + security + redesign)
- **Email+password auth** (primary sign-in): `/api/auth/register` (zod + bcryptjs cost 12,
  20 starter credits), `credentials` provider in `lib/auth.ts`, login page rewritten with
  Sign in / Create account tabs. Dev Login now hard-disabled in production builds
  (`NODE_ENV !== 'production'` gate) — prod uses real accounts.
- **Payments (Phase 4, mock provider — Stripe-ready)**: `Payment` model + `PaymentStatus`/
  `PurchaseKind` enums (migration `add_password_and_payments`); catalog in `lib/products.ts`
  (Pro $19/400cr, Premium $49/1200cr + credit packs 100/$5, 400/$18, 1200/$45);
  `lib/payments.ts` provider abstraction + idempotent `fulfillPayment` (PENDING→COMPLETED
  transition and grant in one transaction — webhook replays are no-ops); `/api/checkout`,
  internal test checkout page `/checkout/[id]` (card 4242…), `/api/checkout/[id]/confirm`;
  `/api/payments/webhook` placeholder returns 501 until Stripe keys exist. Plans page wired
  to real checkout + credit-packs section; account page shows billing history + clip gallery.
  Old fake PaymentModal deleted.
- **Prod video generation fixed (was dead on Vercel)**: fal jobs now submit with
  `fal_webhook` → new `/api/video/fal-webhook?jobId&sig` route (HMAC-SHA256 keyed by
  N8N_CALLBACK_SECRET, timing-safe). Shared finalize logic extracted to
  `lib/video-finalize.ts` (callback + webhook use it). Stub provider completes inline on
  Vercel (timers freeze after response). Self-host transcode skipped on Vercel with local
  storage driver (read-only FS) — raw provider URL used instead. `create` route: PROCESSING
  set before `start()` (inline completion could be clobbered), FAILED on start throw.
- **Security**: in-memory rate limiting (`lib/rate-limit.ts`) on register/login/checkout/
  confirm/video-create; security headers + CSP in next.config; zod validation on new routes;
  timing-safe secret comparison in callback; account-scoped ownership checks on payments.
- **Redesign (aurora, serious upgrade)**: full-bleed cinema-frame hero (real Kling render +
  animated gradient headline + "the prompt" caption bar with blinking caret); studio page
  rebuilt (prompt console + sticky Screening room with elapsed timer, adaptive 2.5s→5s
  polling, unified aura palette — slate/neon classes gone, dev-scaffolding cards removed);
  AuthWidget links to account. DemoVideoPanel + `/api/demo-video` deleted (orphaned).
- Validated locally end-to-end: register → login (wrong password rejected, no session) →
  checkout Pro → fulfill (plan PRO, 420 credits, replay idempotent) → stub video DONE →
  1 credit spent; all pages 200; register rate limit fires 429 on 11th attempt; `tsc` +
  `next build` clean.

## 2026-06-12 (production database + working login on the live demo)
- Provisioned Neon Postgres through the Vercel Marketplace integration and connected it
  to the `lumora` project; ran both Prisma migrations against it. Enabled Dev Login on
  prod (any email, no password — demo-friendly). Verified the full flow live: sign-in
  creates a user in Neon with 20 starter credits / FREE plan.
- Gotchas hit: `vercel env add` via piped stdin stored EMPTY values (use `--value` flag);
  `vercel env pull` shows sensitive prod vars as empty by design (don't trust it for
  verification — test at runtime); `vercel integration add neon` OVERWRITES `.env.local`
  with pulled envs — our local file was lost and rebuilt (FAL_KEY must be re-pasted from
  the fal.ai dashboard; local DB password recovered from the bogi_db container).

## 2026-06-11 (Tailwind config fix — primary buttons had no background)
- Tailwind v4 doesn't auto-load `tailwind.config.ts`, so every custom utility (aura-*
  colors, shadow-glow, rounded-4xl, font-display) silently produced nothing — primary
  buttons rendered as bare text with no background/border (reported on Plans "Go Pro"
  and the home hero). Fix: `@config "../../tailwind.config.ts";` in globals.css.
  Restores the full gradient brand identity site-wide. README screenshots re-shot.

## 2026-06-11 (GitHub + Vercel launch, Kling showcase)
- Published the project: GitHub repo `randomZname/lumora` (public) + Vercel production
  deploy at https://lumora-delta-lyart.vercel.app. Repo hygiene: `/media`, `/public/uploads`,
  `Prompts.txt` gitignored (runtime/user data); `.env.example` un-ignored; verified no real
  secrets in any committed file. README rewritten (product pitch, stack, screenshots, live
  demo link). Added `postinstall: prisma generate` for Vercel builds.
- Regenerated all 6 showcase clips with **Kling 2.5 Turbo Pro t2v** (detailed cinematic
  prompts, 16:9, 5s) — old samples were low quality. Compressed to 720p H.264 (~0.5–1.8MB
  each) + fresh poster JPGs via ffmpeg-static. Same filenames → zero code changes. The
  "made with the same pipeline" claim stays true. Removed unused `public/images/{city-rain,
  portrait-neon}.jpg`. Re-shot README screenshots.
- Known Vercel limits (tracked in ISSUES): no production DB yet (login/generation disabled,
  DATABASE_URL is a placeholder), and stub/fal providers rely on post-response `setTimeout`
  which serverless freezes — generation needs a webhook flow for prod.

## 2026-06-08 (model picker: no image requirement)
- Dropped the "Kling needs an image" rule. Now ANY model choice works with or without an image:
  image present → image-to-video, absent → text-to-video. Confirmed Kling has a t2v endpoint
  (`fal-ai/kling-video/v2.5-turbo/pro/text-to-video`) and wired it in `resolveModelByChoice`.
  Removed the server 400 + client validation + "needs image" hint. Verified: kling + no image
  → 200, job.model = kling text-to-video.

## 2026-06-08 (model selector in studio)
- Added a **Model picker** in the studio: Auto / LTX (fast) / Kling (premium). Choice flows
  form → create route → provider (`GenerateInput.model`, `resolveModelByChoice`). Kling without
  an image is rejected (client + server 400). Verified: kling+no-image → 400; ltx+image records
  the LTX i2v slug (override respected).

## 2026-06-08 (model tracking)
- VideoJob now records the actual fal `model` used (was always null) — create route stores
  `resolveFalModel(hasImage)`. Status API returns `model`; the studio shows "Generated with
  Kling 2.5 Turbo / LTX Video" on a finished clip. Clarifies which model made each video:
  image upload → Kling, text-only → LTX.

## 2026-06-08 (Kling default for image-to-video)
- Set **Kling 2.5 Turbo Pro** as the default image-to-video model (FAL_MODEL + code default).
  Faster + higher quality (~$0.07/clip). Text-to-video (no image) stays on LTX (Kling has no
  text-only endpoint here). FalProvider is now param-aware: Kling gets `duration`, LTX gets `num_frames`.
- Verified live: image→Kling render DONE in ~71s (vs ~130s on LTX), output self-hosted via
  /api/media with Range 206.

## 2026-06-08 (fix: studio poll timeout)
- Studio showed "time run out" on normal renders — the UI poll budget (40×2.5s = 100s) was
  shorter than fal render time (~130s). Raised to 120×3s (~6 min) so jobs finish before timeout.

## 2026-06-08 (fast playback: self-hosted output pipeline)
- **Generated videos now play instantly.** Root cause of slow playback: we served the raw
  fal.media URL (remote, no faststart). Fix (agent-team build from `docs/BUILD_PLAN_2.md`):
  - New `src/lib/media.ts` — downloads the fal result and transcodes via ffmpeg-static to
    faststart H.264 + a poster frame (with `-nostdin`, maxBuffer, 90s timeout so it can never hang).
  - Callback route post-processes the result, stores it via the storage layer, and uses our
    hosted URL (graceful fallback to the raw fal URL if transcode fails — result never lost).
  - `create-video` shows an animated skeleton while rendering.
- **New media serving route `/api/media/[...path]`** with **HTTP Range (206)** support, since
  `next start` does not serve files added to `public/` after build. LocalDiskStorage now writes
  to `<cwd>/media` and returns `/api/media/...` URLs.
- Fixed two bugs found in validation: ffmpeg `ENOENT` (Next bundled the ffmpeg-static path →
  marked it `serverComponentsExternalPackages` + added a runtime path fallback); the 404 above.
- **Verified live:** create → DONE → `outputUrl=/api/media/outputs/<id>.mp4`; full GET 200
  `video/mp4` with `accept-ranges: bytes`; Range request returns 206 in ~7ms; poster 200.

## 2026-06-08 (unique redesign + media + premium model)
- **Full visual redesign → brand "Lumora"** (name/tagline centralized in `src/lib/brand.ts`,
  one-line changeable). New "aurora" identity: deep-void base, violet→rose→gold signature
  gradient, Space Grotesk + Inter type, animated CSS aurora background (replaced canvas dots),
  film-grain overlay. Rewrote globals.css + tailwind palette (added `aura.*`; kept `neon.*`
  as remapped aliases so nothing breaks). Rewrote Navbar, Footer, Card, Button, AuthWidget,
  ParticleBackground, and all pages (home, about, faq, plans, login, account) + studio intro.
- **Filled all empty media spots with real AI content.** Generated 6 showcase clips
  (cyber-alley, solar-bloom, neon-city, aurora-veil, ink-bloom, dune-drift) + 3 stills
  (portrait-neon, city-rain, astro-shore) via fal; wired into hero, showcase grid, demo panel,
  about. Optimized every clip (faststart + 640px + crf30 → ~50–140KB each) with posters.
- **Login reworked** for dev sign-in (email form), since Google is deferred; AuthWidget links to it.
- **Premium model validated live:** Kling 2.5 Turbo Pro
  (`fal-ai/kling-video/v2.5-turbo/pro/image-to-video`) generated a real clip — set as the
  premium upgrade (swap `FAL_MODEL`). LTX stays the cheap default.
- **Full re-validation:** `tsc` exit 0; `npm run build` 14 routes; all 7 pages + all media 200;
  E2E via HTTP (dev-login → create) PASS for BOTH text-only and with-image.

## 2026-06-08 (speed)
- **Video load speed fixed.** Sample mp4s were ~2.6MB total with the moov atom at the end
  (browser had to download the whole file before playback). Re-encoded with ffmpeg-static:
  faststart + 640px + crf30 → **~300KB total (8–11× smaller)**, plus generated poster jpgs.
  Added `poster` + tuned `preload` (metadata on hero, none on below-fold examples) so a still
  shows instantly and playback starts immediately.
- **Production build verified.** Added `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds` (lint config debt) so
  `npm run build` succeeds; `npm start` page loads measured ~90–105ms (dev mode compiles per
  request and is far slower). 14 routes, First Load JS ~87–97KB.
- Generated-video player now autoplays muted with `preload="metadata"`.

## 2026-06-08 (text-to-video + media)
- **Image is now optional → text-to-video.** Schema `VideoJob.inputImageUrl` made nullable
  (migration `image_optional`); create route no longer requires an image; `FalProvider`
  picks `FAL_MODEL_T2V` (default `fal-ai/ltx-video-13b-distilled`) when no image, else the
  image-to-video model. UI: image marked optional, prompt is the only required field.
- **Added real sample media.** Generated 3 branded clips via fal text-to-video and saved to
  `public/samples/` (cyber-alley, solar-bloom, neon-city). This also live-validated the t2v slug.
- **Filled empty media spots:** home hero now plays a looping real AI clip; the 3 "example
  previews" show real sample videos (were just gradients); `DemoVideoPanel` fixed — `/api/demo-video`
  now returns a local sample when n8n isn't configured (was always erroring).
- `tsc --noEmit` passes; pages 200; demo API returns sample; all sample assets serve 200.

## 2026-06-08 (later)
- **Phase 3 start — fal.ai integration coded.** `FalProvider` now submits to the fal queue
  API (`https://queue.fal.run/{model}`), polls status in-process (webhooks can't reach
  localhost in dev), and forwards the finished video URL to our own `/api/video/callback`.
  Image sent as a base64 data URI (no public hosting needed locally). Model via `FAL_MODEL`
  (default cheap `fal-ai/ltx-video-13b-distilled/image-to-video` ~$0.02/clip; premium swap later).
  Refactored StubProvider to share a `postCallback` helper. `GenerateInput` gains
  `imageBuffer`/`imageContentType`; create route passes the bytes.
- Duration options changed 10/15 → **5/10s** (matches Kling/LTX), in UI + create route.
- `tsc --noEmit` passes.
- **fal.ai LIVE TEST PASS.** With real FAL_KEY: submitted to LTX queue → COMPLETED →
  real mp4 returned (verified HTTP 200, ~450KB). Confirmed both a public image_url and a
  base64 **data-URI** (the app's exact path) are accepted; output shape `{video:{url},...}`
  matches FalProvider parsing. Cost ~$0.02/clip. `.env.local` now VIDEO_PROVIDER=fal; dev
  server restarted on fal. Remaining: drive the full browser login→create→video loop.

## 2026-06-08
- **Agent-team build of Phases 0–2 complete** (5 agents, contract-first, no file conflicts):
  schema→Postgres + `VideoJob`/`CreditTransaction`; `lib/{storage,video-provider,credits}.ts`;
  typed NextAuth (zero `as any`); video routes `create`/`callback`/`[id]` with auth +
  credit enforcement (spent on success only); async create-video UI (submit→poll→video);
  `docker-compose.yml` (n8n+minio), `.env.example`, `docs/SETUP.md`.
- Lead fixes during validation: Button `as="a"` anchor variant now accepts `onClick`
  (pre-existing bug surfaced by first `tsc`); installed `@aws-sdk/client-s3` for S3Storage.
- Validation: `npx tsc --noEmit` passes (exit 0). `npm run lint` blocked by ESLint v9
  flat-config migration (logged in ISSUES; does not affect dev/build runtime).
- **Runtime bring-up + smoke test PASS.** Created `mvp_ai` DB on `bogi_db`; wrote `.env.local`
  (generated secrets, stub provider, local storage); added Dev Login (CredentialsProvider,
  ENABLE_DEV_LOGIN) so the authed flow is testable without Google; removed old sqlite
  migrations/dev.db and ran `prisma migrate dev` (init_postgres). Dev server boots; verified:
  pages 200; `create`/`[id]`/`callback` reject unauthorized (401/secret); seeded job + callback
  → job DONE, 1 credit spent, SPEND tx logged, second callback does not double-charge.
- Google OAuth deferred per user decision; will re-enable when creds are added.

## 2026-06-07
- Created `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md` — contract-first agent-team plan for Phases 0–2
  (foundation + auth + async video core with StubProvider), strict file ownership,
  staged spawning. Ready for /build with agents.
- Created project "brain": `CLAUDE.md` + `docs/{VISION,ARCHITECTURE,ROADMAP,TASKS,CHANGELOG,ISSUES}.md`
  — so the full plan/state survives across sessions and the project can grow via files.
- Audited environment — verified specs (Ryzen 7 5700U, 34GB RAM, no NVIDIA GPU),
  installed tools (Node v24, Docker 29 + Compose v5, Python 3.12, git), and found
  existing Docker containers `bogi_db` (Postgres 16+pgvector) and `bogi_litellm` (LiteLLM).
  Decision: reuse `bogi_db` (new `mvp_ai` DB) instead of a new Postgres.
- Researched competitors (Runway/Kling/Luma/Pika) + APIs — chose fal.ai as video
  provider (one API: free SVD now → premium Kling/Veo/Sora later; free signup credits).
- Reviewed existing codebase — logged findings in `ISSUES.md`.
